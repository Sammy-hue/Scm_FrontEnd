                <h2>Aim</h2>
                <p>To plot and analyze the forward and reverse characteristics of PN junction of Si/Ge diode and determine the knee voltage.</p>
            
                <h2>Apparatus</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>PN Junction / semiconductor diode characteristic Trainer kit</li>
                    <li>Connecting leads</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>Theory</h2>
                <p>A P-N junction is formed when a p-type semiconductor is suitably joined to an n-type semiconductor, creating a contact surface known as the PN junction. This diode has two terminals called anode and cathode. A plot of voltage across the diode (V) versus the current flowing through it (I) is known as the V-I characteristics of a diode, representing the response of a P-N junction.</p>
            
                <h3>Forward Biasing</h3>
                <p>If the positive terminal of the input supply is connected to the anode (P-side) and the negative terminal is connected to the cathode, the diode is said to be forward biased. In this condition, the height of the potential barrier at the junction is reduced, allowing holes from the p-side and electrons from the n-side to cross the junction and create a forward current.</p>
            
                <h3>Reverse Biasing</h3>
                <p>When the negative terminal of the input supply is connected to the anode (P-side) and the positive terminal to the cathode (n-side), the diode is reverse biased. Here, the potential barrier height increases, preventing significant current flow. A small reverse saturation current, however, continues to flow.</p>
            
                <h2>Procedure</h2>
